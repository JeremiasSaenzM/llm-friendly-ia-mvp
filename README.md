# LLM-Friendly IA MVP

This repository contains a small, documented MVP exploring how
Information Architecture can be structured to better support
LLM ingestion while remaining understandable to humans.

## Purpose
- Practice frontend-adjacent engineering skills
- Explore IA patterns optimized for AI agents
- Document decisions and tradeoffs clearly

## Scope (MVP)
- No production data
- No live backend
- Static or mock content only
- Focus on structure, not scale

## Documentation
This repo intentionally documents:
- Setup decisions
- IA modeling assumptions
- Tradeoffs between human vs LLM-oriented structure
